# Kaggle-Competition-Image-Matching-Challenge-2025  

Kaggle Image Matching Challenge 2025 – Top 7% (out of 943 teams)   

## Task:   
Estimate relative camera poses and reconstruct consistent 3D scenes from large-scale and unstructured imageset. Designed a complete 3D reconstruction pipeline (DINOv2, LightGlue, COLMAP) and proposed key optimizations,
including CLIP-based retrieval, refined two-stage feature matching, and advanced geometric consistency checks.
